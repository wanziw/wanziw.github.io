<p>这篇论文排除了horizontal的方法，因为只有单一模态，而且来自多个source</p>
<h3 id="model-architecture">model architecture</h3>
<p>7 types:VAE, AE, encoders, GAN, FCNN, GNN and heterogenous models</p>
<p>重点是讲了VAE，VAE中采用递进的方式，一个模型比一个模型改进。递进结束之后也可以每一段讲了一个难点，然后讲一个/几个模型是使用什么方法解决的</p>
<ol>
<li>scIM(unpaired data):整合了scRNA-seq 和 CyTOF （蛋白）不同技术，整合到相同的潜在空间中，，并通过模拟数据与真实数据验证了细胞匹配的伪时序一致性。但是无法实现一种模态到另一种的预测</li>
<li>scMM：也是将多种模式集成到一个共享空间，但是使用了‘mixture of experts model’ (MOE)，实现跨模态预测</li>
<li>Cobolt：目前单模态数据在<strong>质量和数量</strong>上都优于联合模态数据（同时在一个细胞里测多组学，容易有噪声），使用三个encoder，：一种用于 scRNA-seq，一种用于联合模态数据 (scRNA-seq + scATAC-seq)，另一种用于 scATAC-seq</li>
<li>问题1:之前的MDL模型都是使用<strong>joint embedding</strong>（preserves modality-specific information）。**（提出问题）**问题就是noise or sparsity容易出现在联合模态数据中
<ol>
<li>scMVAE：两个单模态encoder，分别用于scRNA-seq、scATAC-seq data，进行进行<strong>标准化</strong>、<strong>去噪</strong>和<strong>插补</strong>（imputation）。一个多模态encoder，整合不同模态的数据。</li>
<li>scMVP：使用一些联合学习技术在scMVAE基础上改进，比如特征拼接、a cell-type-guided attention module</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>问题2:不同的组学数据distribution不同，比如 scATAC-seq相比scRNA-Seq数据量更小、稀疏且变化大，数据不平衡，容易overfit
<ol>
<li>SAILERX</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>问题3:蛋白数据的技术偏差和噪声
<ol>
<li>totalVI</li>

<li>GLUE</li>

Horizontal integration uses shared features like genes to link data from different modalities, while vertical integration uses paired cells as anchors. In contrast, diagonal integration methods perform integration without using paired cells or shared features as anchors. These methods aim to build a simplified representation of the relationships between data modalities, assuming an underlying low-dimensional structure links them. The current review excludes studies in the horizontal category because they often use only one data modality from different sources. As shown in Table 2, only a few papers have used unpaired cells of different modalities to perform diagonal integration. SCIM, crossmodal-AE, STACI, GLUE, scJoint, sciCAN, scDART and Portal are examples of diagonal integration methods. Crossmodal-AE, scJoint and Portal perform both vertical and diagonal integration on paired or unpaired cell types.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Table 2 also describes the datasets based on data sources, technology or platform used for sequencing the data and comparing modalities. Most studies performed the integration task between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq [68, 76, 77, 83, 85, 91, 95, 100, 101, 105, 107, 119, 123, 130, 131]. Some studies performed integration of multiple modality pairs like scMM [76], Cobolt [77], SMILE [95], Portal [123], scMoGNN and scMDC [133]. For example, besides integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, scMM and totalVI also integrated scRNA-seq and surface protein profiling data. Crossmodal-AE is the only study that performed integration between chromatin image and scRNA-seq data. STACI [135] integrated single-cell spatial transcriptomics data with chromatin images. Some studies go beyond modality pairs and can integrate multiple data modalities. For example, GLUE integrated three different omics data modalities and named it triple omics integration. SMILE also integrated three modalities using a combination of the two model variants.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Model architecture classification**</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Table 3 summarizes the recent MDL models developed for single-cell multi-omics data integration. All the models used two-dimensional numerical matrices to represent the input data. We categorize these models into seven groups, VAE, AE, encoders, GAN, FCNN, GNN and heterogenous models, detailed as follows.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">#### 4.2.1 VAE-based models</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">SCIM adopts VAE to integrate scRNA-seq and CyTOF modalities. Each modality is modeled by an encoder-decoder network, and a discriminator is incorporated to identify a specific source modality from the latent representation of other modalities. Through adversarial training, SCIM can generate an integrated latent space. However, SCIM cannot predict one modality from another and thus cannot accomplish cross-modal translation tasks.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">scMM, similar to SCIM, aims to integrate multiple modalities into a shared space. However, scMM has the additional capability of cross-modal translation. scMM uses a VAE to integrate two modalities. The encoder-decoder network first takes the feature vectors for each modality as input. An encoder is trained to generate a low-dimensional joint variational posterior that can be factorized by a ‘mixture of experts model’ (MOE) [137]. This joint representation is then used to train decoders that reconstruct the underlying data distribution in each modality. The MOE factorization enables the separation of each modality from the joint representations, which helps scMM to perform cross-modality predictions.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Cobolt adopts an approach similar to scMM in projecting different modalities into a shared latent space. However, Cobolt distinguishes itself from scMM in its attempt to integrate joint-modality data with single-modality data. Given the current prevalence of single-modality data over joint-modality data in both quality and quantity [77], there is a strong interest in integrating both types of multi-omics data. Cobolt employs three encoders to learn the latent feature distributions of the input modalities: one for scRNA-seq, one for joint-modality data (scRNA-seq + scATAC-seq) and another for scATAC-seq. Each encoder learns separate latent embeddings and posterior distributions of latent variables. Cobolt then projects the modalities into a shared latent space by taking the posterior mean of these distributions. Finally, three separate decoders learn from the shared latent embeddings.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The MDL models described earlier can generate a shared feature representation (joint embedding) that preserves modality-specific information [105]. However, when significant noise or sparsity exists in joint-modality data, the resulting joint embedding may not accurately capture the biological variation, causing difficulties in downstream analysis and interpretation [105]. To address this issue, scMVAE and scMVP were developed. scMVAE utilizes one multimodal encoder, two single-modal encoders and two single-modal decoders. The multimodal encoder models scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data with three joint-learning techniques. One is to estimate a joint posterior from the product of posteriors of each modality. One is to learn a joint-learning space using a neural network, and another is to obtain a concatenation of the original features of each modality. Meanwhile, the single-modal encoders play the roles of data normalization, denoising and imputation of the input modalities. scMVP has the same architecture as scMVAE, but scMVP’s joint-modality encoder only uses a neural network to learn the joint-learning space of the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq modalities. scMVP improves joint embedding by connecting its two decoders through a cell-type-guided attention module that captures the correlation between the two modalities. Furthermore, scMVP’s single-modal encoders are connected to the joint embedding with two extra modules that ensure clustering consistency.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The assumption that all data sources are equally valuable and follow the same distribution is not always true. For example, in scATAC-seq experiments, the amount of data per cell is typically lower and more variable than in scRNA-Seq experiments from the same cell [100]. Directly combining data using neural networks from such imbalanced modalities can lead to overfitting [100]. SAILERX was introduced to address these challenges by only learning scATAC-seq data with a VAE, and for scRNA-seq, using pre-trained scRNA-seq embeddings. SAILERX also enforces similarity between the latent space of both modalities through regularization, which preserves local cell structure across modalities. The goal is to avoid overfitting and allow hybrid integration of joint profiling data with single-modality data, similar to Cobolt.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Combining RNA and protein data to create a unified representation of cell state is challenging due to technical biases and inherent noise in each data modality. In particular, protein data presents a unique challenge due to background noise from ambient or nonspecifically bound antibodies [87]. The VAE-based totalVI model provides a solution for integrating scRNA-seq and protein data while correcting for protein background noise. To achieve this, totalVI takes matrices of scRNA-seq and protein count data as input, along with categorical covariates such as experimental batch or donor information. The encoder then generates a joint latent representation of both modalities, which helps to control modality-specific noise properties and batch effects. Finally, the decoder estimates the parameters of the underlying distributions of both modalities from the joint latent representation while correcting for protein background noise.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Integrating unpaired multi-omics data can be difficult since each modality has unique feature spaces. To address this issue, GLUE was developed to integrate unpaired multi-omics data via graph-guided embeddings. GLUE uses a separate VAE to model each data modality. To merge modality-specific feature spaces, GLUE constructed a knowledge-based graph using cross-modality regulatory interactions, with vertices representing the features of different omics data modalities and edges representing regulatory interactions. A variational graph AE (VGAE) is adopted to create graph embeddings from the knowledge-based graph. The VGAE is then connected with the modality-specific decoders to help integrate these unpaired multi-omics data.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The above-discussed MDL techniques were not designed specifically for online integration tasks [131]. As a solution, SCALEX was developed to continuously integrate new single-cell multi-omics data without recalculating all previous integrations [131]. The VAE-based SCALEX model aims to create a generalized encoder for data projection without retraining, and it achieves this through three key design elements.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">#### 4.2.2 AE-based models</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Several studies have adopted AEs for multimodal data integration. One such approach is the k-coupled AE, which uses a multi-agent AE approach [71], where each AE agent learns a modality separately. These agent AEs are coupled by an overall cost function that measures the dissimilarity among the representations learned by the agent AEs. All agent AEs minimize this overall cost function during training to produce a better integrated latent representation. The k-coupled AE is useful for cross-modal translation. Another study, BABEL, uses two AE-based architecture to generate cross-modal translation. Two separate encoders learn two modalities separately and project them into a shared latent space, which is learned by two decoders to create the original modalities. Another AE-based model, scMDC, focuses on accurately clustering single-cell data. It uses a multimodal AE to learn a joint latent representation from the concatenated modalities of scRNA-seq and (CITE-seq or scATAC-sesq). Unlike the previous studies focusing on sequencing data only, crossmodal-AE integrates image and sequencing data. The approach of the crossmodal-AE is similar to BABEL. However, the AEs are customized according to specific modalities in crossmodal-AE. For example, to project single-cell image data, scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and single-cell Hi-C data into the shared latent space, AEs corresponding to CNN, FCNN and GNN are designed, respectively. STACI extended the work of crossmodal-AE, which used AE with over-parameterization. Over-parameterization means extending the size of hidden layers to be greater than the input feature space. The model used separate decoders to obtain each modality from the latent embedding.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">#### 4.2.3 Encoder-based models</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The encoder-based SMILE model integrates single-cell multi-omics data using contrastive learning. There are two variants of SMILE: pSMILE and mpSMILE. The former has two encoders corresponding to two input modalities. One-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are applied to each encoder to reduce the dimensionality of its output. The outputs are then subjected to noise contrastive estimation to maximize mutual information in the shared latent space. mpSMILE uses two encoders as well but has one encoder duplicated to give more weight to the corresponding data modality. Doing so can improve discriminative representations [107, 138]. In another study, scJoint presents an encoder-based transfer learning method that learns a joint embedding space from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. Since unpaired multi-omics data integration is challenging due to distinct feature spaces, scJoint uses two loss functions to identify orthogonal latent features and maximize the alignment of different modalities. In addition to a cross-entropy loss for cell-type prediction, the joint embedding space can be used by a k-nearest neighbor approach to transfer cell labels from scRNA-seq cells to ATAC-seq cells, further improving the joint embedding space.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">#### 4.2.4 GAN-based models</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">MAGAN is a model that addresses the challenge of integrating unpaired data using a manifold alignment strategy. MAGAN uses a dual GAN framework consisting of two GANs, which align manifolds from two modalities. One GAN is responsible for creating a mapping from the first modality to the second modality, while the other GAN learns the mapping from the second to the first modality.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**FCNN**: Existing methods for integrating unpaired data into a single latent space primarily focus on cells that form clusters rather than continuous cells that follow trajectories [8, 9, 139]. scDART addresses this limitation by utilizing a FCNN to project data into a shared latent space while preserving cell trajectories. The scDART model consists of two parts: the gene activity function, which generates a ‘pseudo-scRNA-seq’ count matrix from scATAC-seq data; and the projection module, which takes both the original scRNA-seq data and the ‘pseudo-scRNA-seq’ data as input to produce a shared latent space. The diffusion/random-walk-based distances between cells along the trajectory manifold in the original and the latent space are considered in the overall loss function to preserve the cell trajectory structure.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Graph neural network (GNN)**: Integration studies like BABEL, scMM and Cobolt often treat each cell as an independent input, which can overlook important high-order interactions between cells and modalities. Such interactions are critical for effective learning from single-cell data’s high-dimensional and sparse cell features. scMoGNN leverages GNNs to integrate single-cell modalities while preserving high-order structural information to address this limitation. Specifically, scMoGNN first constructs a cell-feature graph from a given modality and applies a graph CNN (GCNN) to obtain latent embeddings of cells. These cell embeddings are then fed into a task-specific head for downstream tasks such as modality prediction, matching and joint embedding.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Heterogenous model**: The SMILE model, mentioned earlier, requires cell anchors and can only be applied when corresponding cells are known across multiple modalities. sciCAN was developed to address this limitation. The sciCAN model consists of representation learning using an encoder and modality alignment using a GAN. The encoder employs noise contrastive estimation as its loss function to learn a joint low-dimensional representation. The GAN component includes two discriminators: one identifies source domains represented by a latent representation, and the other generates one data modality from the other, such as chromatin accessibility data from gene expression data. sciCAN differentiates itself from similar models like single-cell GAN (scGAN) [140] and AD-AE by using one additional cycle-consistent adversarial network, which introduces cycle-consistent loss to learn the connections between two modalities.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">With the emergence of Atlas-level scRNA-seq datasets, there is a growing need for integration techniques that can handle large numbers of cell populations and are computationally scalable. In response, the Portal model was developed. To align single-cell datasets, the Portal model employs a domain translation network of two encoders, generators and discriminators. The encoders learn latent embeddings for input modalities, the generators generate one modality data from the latent embedding of the other modality and the discriminators identify non-aligned data points to improve network training further.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Key tasks**</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Single-cell data integration can be divided into three key tasks: modality prediction, matching and joint embedding [98]. In the modality prediction task, one modality is predicted given the other modality. Among the surveyed papers, MAGAN and k-coupled AE both perform modality prediction tasks, as shown in Table 3. MAGAN predicts scRNA-seq from CyTOF or vice versa, while k-coupled AE predicts neuron morphological data from scRNA-seq. No studies have focused solely on modality matching. SCIM, Cobolt, scMVAE, SAILERX, GLUE, scMVP, Portal, MIRA and SCALEX all perform joint embedding tasks exclusively. In contrast, scMM performs joint embedding and modality prediction simultaneously. First, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq modalities are jointly embedded, then used by decoders to predict one modality given another. Similarly, BABEL, scJoint, sciCAN, totalVI, crossmodal-AE, STACI and scDART perform both joint embedding and modality prediction tasks on various single-cell omics data modalities. SMILE performs joint embedding and modality matching tasks with scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, DNA methylation and Hi-C modalities. scMoGNN performs all three tasks (joint embedding, modality prediction and modality matching) with mRNA, scATAC-seq and ADT modalities.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Fusion methods**</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Methods for integrating data from multiple modalities in an MDL model architecture are called fusion methods. Three types of fusion strategies have been identified: early fusion, intermediate fusion and late fusion [52] (as shown in Figure 2). The fusion strategies of the various studies are detailed as follows (Table 4).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Early fusion**: The strategy of ‘early fusion’ involves concatenating input features from different modalities to serve as the input of a deep learning model (Figure 3A). scMVAE, totalVI, STACI and SCALEX are among the studies that utilized the early fusion strategy. These studies aggregated modalities first and then utilized VAE to learn the joint latent embedding.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Intermediate fusion**: The majority of studies we surveyed have used intermediate fusion, where the modalities are learned first and fused later inside the MDL model. For instance, in Figure 3B, the marginal representation of modality 1 and 2 are learned first and integrated later inside the neural network layer. Intermediate fusion can be further classified into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous fusion is used when the modalities are learned through the same type of neural network. In contrast, heterogeneous fusion is used when the modalities are learned through different types of neural networks. Moreover, based on representation, both homogeneous and heterogeneous fusion can be divided into marginal and joint types. The marginal representation uses features to represent latent components based on a single modality, while joint representation encodes information from several modalities.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">In joint homogeneous fusion, marginal representations are first concatenated, and then a joint representation is learned from that concatenated marginal representation. For example, SCIM assumes joint homogeneous fusion since modalities are learned by two separate VAEs and then imposed into a shared latent space. Joint heterogeneous intermediate fusion is a good strategy for learning informative cross-modality interactions, where different modalities are learned through different types of neural networks concatenated. Then, a joint representation is learned from that concatenated marginal representation using a separate neural network. For example, crossmodal-AE, SAILERX and sciCAN follow the joint heterogeneous fusion strategy.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The marginal homogeneous fusion strategy involves using the same type of neural network to learn marginal feature representation from different modalities, which are later merged into the decision function. For example, SMILE adopted this strategy by using two separate encoders to learn two modalities and create two latent embeddings, followed by two MLPs that learned from both embeddings to minimize the model’s loss.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Late fusion**: Late fusion integrates the decisions of separate models to make a final decision (Figure 3C). k-Coupled AE and MIRA are examples of models that use the late fusion strategy. In k-coupled AE, two modalities are learned through two separate coupled AE, and the latent representations are later aggregated. In MIRA, two modalities are learned through two separate VAEs, and the latent representations are combined later to make the final decision.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Downstream analysis**</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The integration of single-cell modalities using MDL provides great assistance for downstream analysis. Following integration, the MDL models are assessed through downstream analysis and utilized for such purposes. Commonly practiced downstream analysis includes cell type discovery, differential expression analysis (DE), cell trajectory inference, cell matching and cis-regulatory analysis, as detailed below (Table 3).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Cell type discovery**: The goal of cell type discovery is to identify the different types of cells present within a sample. Most tools performed cell type discovery to validate their results and illustrate their usage. For example, SCIM recovered T cells by integrating scRNA and CyTOF modalities. scJoint found 19 cell types common between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. However, the detected cell types often vary across the studies. For instance, in the crossmodal-AE study, scRNA-seq data from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [93] was analyzed and clustered, revealing the presence of four types of T cells. In comparison, SAILERX clustered the PBMC 10k dataset [2] and identified 29 cell types. Similarly, scMM performed clustering on the same PBMC dataset [2] and identified 54 cell types. Cell type discovery accuracy is often validated by comparing the consistency of the detected cell types with the cell labels annotated in the original data. For example, scMM compared their discovered cell types with the cell-type annotation of PBMC dataset [2]. Some studies such as SCALEX validated cell type discovery by assessing through quantitative clustering metrics such as ARI (adjusted Rand index), NMI (normalized mutual information) and silhouette scores. Crossmodal-AE performed protein immunofluorescence staining to validate the discovered cell types. In this experiment, they selected two genes, CORO1A and RPL10A, that were predicted to be strongly upregulated in specific subpopulations of naive T cells with distinct patterns of chromatin density. They then analyzed immunofluorescence staining data of the two proteins along with the chromatin images. They demonstrated that the tool effectively aligns gene expression with the image features, allowing for the characterization of distinct subpopulations of naive T cells.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**DE**: The process of DE involves identifying genes that are expressed differently across distinct cell types. This analysis provides insights into how gene expression changes in response to various biological conditions [141]. The reviewed studies utilized DE analysis on several single-cell multi-omics datasets to investigate alterations in gene expression. For example, in a study conducted by Cobolt, DE analysis showed distinct expression levels of Adarb2 and Sox6 genes in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq clusters, which are known markers distinguishing between CGE and Pvalb clusters. The scDART, SCALEX, STACI and SMILE also performed DE on their data and made discoveries supported by the literature. Most studies validated their DE analysis results utilizing the existing evidence. For instance, scDART compared their DE analysis findings with existing evidence [51]. On the other hand, totalVI performed Welch’s t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test to validate their DE analysis findings [87].</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Trajectory inference**: Trajectory inference aims to identify the progression of a cellular dynamic process and organize cells based on their movement through the process. scMVP, sciCAN, scDART and MIRA all performed trajectory inference. For example, scMVP conducted trajectory inference analysis on growing bulge cells of the SHARE-seq mouse skin dataset and identified two paths from αhigh CD34+ bulge to new bulge cells. sciCAN conducted co-trajectory analysis to investigate the hematopoietic hierarchy. The scDART algorithm was evaluated by trajectory inference analysis on a neonatal mouse brain cortex dataset. Moreover, MIRA investigated hair follicle maintenance and differentiation, revealed the hierarchy of different follicle lineages and recreated the true layout of the follicle. All studies validated the trajectory inference results by comparing with the existing evidence [3].</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Cell matching**: Cell matching has been used as an assessment technique to evaluate the effectiveness of joint latent embedding. For example, SCIM employed this strategy to match cells between scRNA and CyTOF modalities in a melanoma tumor sample. Crossmodal-AE employed the cell-matching strategy on the human lung adenocarcinoma dataset [92] to match samples between RNA-seq and ATAC-seq modalities. In addition, scDART evaluated the cell matching capability using the mouse neonatal brain cortex dataset [51]. To evaluate cell matching accuracy, several metrics such as k-nearest neighbors’ accuracy, neighborhood overlapping score and cosine similarity score were utilized. For instance, scDART utilized neighborhood overlapping and cosine similarity scores to evaluate their cell matching accuracy and achieved the neighborhood overlapping scores of 0.6 and the cosine similarity scores of 0.712 in the mouse neonatal brain cortex dataset [51].</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**cis-Regulatory analysis**: cis-Regulatory analysis studies various cis-acting DNA sequences that modulate gene transcription. It includes identifying distal and proximal gene regulatory regions such as enhancers and promoters, transcription factor binding sites and their binding patterns called motifs in regulatory regions, as well as the grammars orchestrated by these binding elements and motifs. Several tools, including scMM, SAILERX, MIRA, GLUE and scMVP, have performed cis-regulatory analysis as a downstream analysis of multi-omics data integration. For example, scMM identified enriched regulatory motifs in genes and peaks associated with latent dimensions, while SAILERX determined the top motifs that were most enriched in individual cell types. MIRA used topic modeling of cell states and the regulatory-potential modeling of individual gene loci to identify enriched motifs, while GLUE identified distal gene regulatory regions based on the cosine similarity between feature embeddings. All studies evaluated cis-regulatory analysis findings by comparing their predictions with the existing evidence. For example, scMVP compared their cis-regulatory analysis findings with a previous study [51] and found a higher enrichment of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 in the translation start site (TSS) distal peaks and H3K4me3 in the TSS proximal regions.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

Additionally, Cobolt can jointly integrate single-modality datasets with multi-omics datasets, allowing one to draw on the many publicly available scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq datasets.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Multigrate (Lotfollahi et al., 2022) is another model that employs a PoE to combine the posteriors of different modalities. Additional datasets can be integrated into the model by minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss between joint representations of different datasets.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Similar to Cobolt and Multigrate, scMM (Minoura et al., 2021) is a VAE-based method that trains an encoder network for each modality independently. However, instead of combining the parameters of the posterior distributions using a PoE, a MoE is used. By equally mixing information from both modalities through the MoE, the model avoids putting too much emphasis on one individual modality only (Minoura et al., 2021). In addition, scMM provides a method for model interpretability that uses latent traversals, where synthetic cells are generated by the learned decoder and one latent variable is modified continually, while the others remain fixed. The Spearman correlations calculated between each latent variable and the features of each modality then allow relevant features to be identified. Additionally, by using a Laplace prior, scMM learns disentangled representations, with correlations between latent variables being penalized, which allows for better interpretation of individual features (Treppner et al., 2022).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Similarly, the MultiVI model presented by Ashuach et al. (2021) is also based on a MoE with αₘ = 1/M where M denotes the number of modalities, as the authors use individual encoders for each data modality and then average the resulting variational posteriors. However, a regularization term is added to the ELBO, which penalizes the distance between the learned latent representations such that a joint representation can be inferred (Ashuach et al., 2021).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">While the single-cell multi-view profiler (scMVP) (Li et al., 2022) is also based on a multimodal VAE architecture with modality-specific encoders and decoders and a joint latent space, it more explicitly accounts for the much higher sparsity of single-cell measurements from joint profiling protocols, with a throughput of only one-tenth to one-fifth of that of single-modality assays (Li et al., 2022). Specifically, the authors employ attention-based building blocks for both the encoder and decoder. Attention mechanisms have first been proposed in computer science in the context of machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2017) and are based on the idea of using flexible weighting of an input observation, to have the model specifically ‘attend to’ the most important parts of the observation. In the context of omics data, attention scores are assigned to the observed features (e.g., genes, chromatin loci) of each cell, to enhance the effect and interplay of specific features. In contrast to fixed weights, the attention scores are learned during model training and can thus adapt to highlight the most informative features for learning, e.g., latent representations. Attention-based mechanisms have specifically been popularized by transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) due to their high performance on sparse datasets in the area of natural language processing or protein structure prediction. In scMVP, the authors build on that by using multi-head self-attention transformer modules to capture local, long-distance correlation in the encoder and decoder of the term frequency-inverse document frequency-transformed (Stuart et al., 2021) scATAC-seq data while using simple attention blocks in the RNA encoder and decoder. Given the latent embedding, the modality-specific decoders are weighted according to the posterior probabilities of cell-type or cluster identity. To encourage consistency of the shared latent space, the decoder-reconstructed values of each modality are again embedded into the latent space, and the KL-divergence between the joint latent embedding and the modality-specific re-embedding from the reconstructed data is minimized as an additional loss term. This corresponds to the idea of cyclical adversarial training as described in Section 2.4 and Figure 1E. More generally, this concept is based on a cycle GAN (Zhu et al., 2017) and is also present in, e.g., Xu et al. (2021a); Zhao et al. (2022); Khan et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2022) and Zuo et al. (2021).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">SCALEX (Xiong et al., 2021) builds on SCALE (Single-Cell ATAC-seq Analysis via Latent feature Extraction) (Xiong et al., 2019), a tool for analyzing scATAC-seq data. The developers of SCALE found that its encoder could be beneficial in disentangling cell-type- and batch-related features, which would allow for online integration of different batches. Specifically, using a VAE, SCALEX integrates different batches into a batch-invariant embedding through simultaneous learning of a batch-free encoder and a batch-specific decoder. The latter contains a domain-specific batch normalization layer. This allows the encoder to concentrate only on batch-invariant biological data components while being oblivious to batch-specific variations. The resulting generalizability of the encoder further allows for the integration of new single-cell data in an online manner, i.e., without the need to retrain the model. The authors demonstrate this property of SCALEX by generating multiple expandable single-cell atlases.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Another subgroup of models addresses the task of translating between different modalities. These cross-modality translation approaches, however, often do not learn a common latent representation of the data. For example, Polarbear (Zhang R. et al., 2022) trains VAEs on each of two modalities (here: scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data) and then links the respective encoders to the decoders of the other modality. The authors intend that the training in the first stage, i.e., the training of the individual VAEs, takes place on publicly available single-assay data, whereby the translation task is carried out on SNARE-seq data in a supervised manner.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Another such model called BABEL (Wu et al., 2021) similarly employs distinct modality-specific encoders and decoders for scRNA- and scATAC-seq data but utilizes a shared latent space. In contrast to PoE/MoE approaches, this joint representation is not constructed from separate spaces from each modality, but the encoders directly project onto the common latent space. Mutual cross-modal translation together with single-modality reconstruction are then used to train the model, i.e., from each modality-specific encoder, a sample of the joint latent representation is obtained and subsequently passed through both decoders to reconstruct both the scRNA and the scATAC profiles of the respective cell. Thus, both the reconstruction of the modality itself and the respective other modality based on the joint latent embedding are evaluated for each modality.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Portal (Zhao et al., 2022) combines a domain translation framework with an adversarial training mechanism to integrate scRNA- and scATAC-seq data. Specifically, modality-specific encoders directly embed the data in a shared latent space and cross-modal generators are introduced to decode the latent representation to the respective other modality. The resulting domain translation networks for each modality are then trained to compete against adversarial discriminators on the domain of each modality that aims to distinguish between original cells from the respective modality and cells translated from the other modality. The discriminators are specifically designed to adaptively distinguish between domain-shared and domain-unique cells by thresholding the discriminator scores. Since, according to the authors, domain-unique cell populations are prone to be assigned with extreme discriminator scores, discriminators are, thus, made effectively inactive on cells with a high probability of being modality-specific, which avoids the risk of over-correction by enforced alignment of domain-unique cells. Further, additional regularizers are employed: an autoencoder loss based on the within-modality reconstructions, a latent alignment loss to encourage the consistency of a specific cell’s embedding and the embedding of its cross-modal reconstruction, and a cosine similarity loss between cells and their cross-modal reconstructions. Notably, Portal uses the first 30 principal components of a joint PCA as inputs for the model and employs a 20-dimensional latent space, such that the dimension reduction component is less pronounced than for the other models, and the data are not modeled as counts.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The authors of Zuo and Chen (2021) have extended scMVAE and proposed Deep Cross-Omics Cycle Attention (DCCA) (Zuo et al., 2021), which improves some of the weaknesses of scMVAE. DCCA combines VAEs with attention transfer. While scMVAE combines two modalities into a shared embedding, which potentially attenuates modality-specific patterns, in the case of DCCA, each data modality is processed by a separate VAE. These VAEs can then learn from each other through mutual supervision based on semantic similarity between the embeddings of each omics modality.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">In the sciCAN model presented by Xu et al. (2021a), modality-specific autoencoders map the input data to a latent space for each modality, and a discriminator is employed to distinguish between the two modalities based on their latent representations. Additionally, a cross-modal generator is employed that generates synthetic scATAC-seq data based on the scRNA-seq latent representation, and a second discriminator is employed to distinguish between generated and real scATAC-seq samples. Additionally, the generated scATAC-seq data can be fed to the encoder again, and the latent representation is compared with the original latent representation from the scRNA-seq data used for generating the scATAC-seq data, thus introducing a cycle consistency loss (see Figure 1E, Section 2.4). Notably, the model does not necessarily expect paired measurements from the same cell but employs a shared encoder for both modalities, and, thus, requires a common feature set.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The authors of Hu et al. (2022) propose the DAVAE model based on domain-adversarial and variational approximation to integrate multiple single-cell datasets and paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. The model employs an adversarial training strategy to remove batch effects and enable transfer learning between modalities, by incorporating a domain classifier that tries to determine the batch or modality label based on the latent representation of VAE and training the VAE encoder to ‘fool’ the classifier via an adversarial loss component. Similarly to Portal and sciCAN, the DAVAE model also employs a shared encoder and thus requires a common set of input features.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Similarly, the scDEC model proposed by Liu et al. (2021) is based on a pair of generative adversarial models to learn a latent representation. While focusing on scATAC-seq data analysis, this approach also allows for integrative analysis of multi-modal scATAC and scRNA-seq datasets for trajectory inference during differentiation processes and cell type identification based on the joint latent representation.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Finally, MIRA (Lynch et al., 2022) combines probabilistic cell-level topic modeling (Blei, 2012) with gene-level regulatory potential (RP) modeling (Wang et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2020) to determine key regulators responsible for fate decisions at lineage branch points. The topic model uses a VAE with a Dirichlet prior to learn both the topic of the gene transcription and the topic of gene accessibility for each cell to derive the cell’s identity. Complementing MIRA’s topic model, its RP model integrates the transcription and accessibility information for each gene locus to infer how the expression of the respective gene is influenced by surrounding regulators. To this end, the topic model learns the rate with which the regulatory influence of enhancers decays with increasing genomic distance. In addition, the identity of key regulators is identified by analyzing transcription factor motif enrichment or occupancy.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">3.2 Approaches for unpaired data</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Since the generation of multi-omics measurements in the same cell is still costly and experimentally complex, many methods for integrating datasets measured in different cells are being developed.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Because of the difficulty of linking latent representations learned from variational autoencoders in the absence of measurement pairing information, Lin et al. (2022) proposed a transfer learning approach. Although not a DGM, it is worth mentioning in this article because of its usefulness and the possibility of adapting it to unsupervised settings. Notably, it represents a method for a horizontal alignment task, i.e., it relies on a common set of features as anchors and thus requires the translation of scATAC peaks to gene activity scores.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">In a similar spirit, the scDART model proposed by Zhang Z. et al. (2022) learns a neural network-based joint embedding of unpaired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data by composing the embedding network with a gene-activity module network that maps scATAC peaks to genes. In addition, scDART can leverage partial cell matching information by using it as a prior to inform the training of the gene activity function.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Similar to the sciCAN model presented by Xu et al. (2021a), scAEGAN (Khan et al., 2022) also embraces the concept of cycle consistency, integrating the adversarial training mechanism of a cycle GAN (Zhu et al., 2017) into an autoencoder framework. Specifically, for each modality, a discriminator and a generator are defined. In addition to the standard GAN loss for each modality, a cycle loss is calculated by mapping a cell from one modality to the second modality with the second modality’s generator and mapping it back to the first modality with the first modality’s generator and comparing that to the original observation. Unlike for Xu et al. (2021a), the model does not rely on a common feature set but first trains an autoencoder model independently for each modality before training a cycle GAN on the two latent spaces to enforce their consistency.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">A similar approach is employed in the Contrastive Cycle Autoencoder (Con-AAE) proposed by Wang et al. (2022). Again, the consistency between latent spaces of modality-specific autoencoders is enforced by a cycle consistency loss. However, here, it is more tightly integrated within the AE architecture, as the modality-specific encoder and decoders are used as generators, i.e., samples from one modality are embedded with the modality-specific encoder but decoded with the decoder of the other modality, and subsequently encoded with the other modality encoder back to the latent space, where they are compared with the original latent representation from the original encoder of the modality.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">A purely GAN-based approach to integrating unpaired data by aligning the respective manifolds is presented in Amodio and Krishnaswamy (2018).</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Another line of research for the integration of unpaired multi-omics data focuses on the concept of optimal transport (Peyré and Cuturi, 2019). A separate embedding or distance matrix is constructed from each modality, and the alignment task is formulated to find an optimal coupling between the two embeddings or distance matrices. An optimal coupling corresponds to finding a map along which one modality can be “transported” with minimal cost to the other, which can be formalized as an optimal transport problem (Peyré and Cuturi, 2019). Examples for such optimal transport-based methods are UnionCom (Cao et al., 2020), SCOT (Demetci et al., 2022) and Pamona (Cao et al., 2021). While these approaches typically rely on computing a coupling between modality-specific distance matrices and are not deep learning-based, a recent approach called uniPort employs a VAE architecture and solves an optimal transport problem in the latent space. More specifically, a shared encoder that requires a common input feature set across modalities is used to project the data into a common latent space, is combined with modality-specific decoders for reconstruction, and an optimal transport loss is minimized between the latent cell embeddings from different modalities.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Finally, the recently published Graph-Linked Unified Embedding (GLUE) framework (Cao and Gao, 2022) is based on the construction of a guidance graph based on prior knowledge of the relations between features of the different modalities to explicitly model regulatory interactions across different modalities with distinct feature spaces. This is achieved by learning joint feature embeddings from the knowledge graph with a graph VAE and linking them to modality-specific autoencoders. Specifically, the decoder of these modality-specific AEs is given by the inner product of the feature embeddings and the cell embeddings from the latent space of the respective modality. Additionally, the cell embeddings of different modalities are aligned using an adversarial discriminator.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

class="line">#### 4.1.1 Pre-processing and Quality Control</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Cell barcodes are essential for distinguishing various cell populations within a sequenced sample. However, inaccuracies such as doublets (multiple cells tagged by a single barcode) and empty droplets/wells (no cells tagged) necessitate a quality control (QC) step in scRNA-seq analysis. Several pre-processing pipelines, including Cell Ranger [94], inDrops [95], SEQC [96], and zUMIs [97], incorporate QC measures. The dimensionality of the resulting count matrix depends on the number of barcodes and transcripts. While noise rates vary across reads and count data, standard research pipelines typically employ uniform processing techniques [98].</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Despite the richness of scRNA-seq data, its complexity and higher noise levels compared to bulk RNA-seq pose significant challenges for raw data processing and downstream analysis. Unwanted variations, such as biases and artifacts, require extensive QC and normalization efforts [99]. Common QC metrics include the number of counts per barcode (count depth), the number of genes detected per barcode, and the fraction of counts from mitochondrial genes [100]. Additionally, experimental factors like sample damage during dissociation can result in low-quality scRNA-seq libraries, leading to erroneous downstream findings. There is a pressing need for more efficient and accurate methods to filter low-quality cells during library preparation. Deep Learning (DL) models, with their multitasking and scaling capabilities, hold promise for end-to-end analyses that perform QC, data correction, and downstream analyses simultaneously. Preliminary works, such as the scVI framework [40], have demonstrated the potential of DL models in developing comprehensive single-cell pipelines.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Due to the limited number of studies focused specifically on pre-processing and QC, this review emphasizes DL applications related to normalization, data correction, and downstream analysis.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">#### 4.1.2 Normalization</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Normalization is a critical initial step in pre-processing scRNA-seq data, addressing issues like low input content and systematic measurement biases [101]. The goal is to detect and remove variations caused by technical artifacts or unintended biological effects, such as batch effects [102]. Traditional normalization methods designed for bulk RNA-seq and microarray data are often applied to scRNA-seq data but may overlook essential scRNA-seq-specific aspects [102].</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">For scRNA-seq, normalization techniques can be categorized into:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- **Scaling Techniques** [103]</span><br><span class="line">- **Regression-Based Techniques** for identified nuisance factors [101,104]</span><br><span class="line">- **Spike-In-Based Techniques** using External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) sequences [105,106]</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">However, these methods are often tailored to specific experiments and may not generalize across different research designs and protocols. While some DL-based normalization methods have been proposed to generalize the normalization process, accounting for the technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data remains an ongoing challenge and active research area [13].</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">#### 4.1.3 Data Correction</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Normalization addresses noise and bias in scRNA-seq data, but normalized data can still exhibit unexpected variability due to technical and biological factors such as batch effects, dropouts, and cell cycle effects. Data correction aims to mitigate these additional sources of variability, which is essential for accurate downstream analyses [107]. It is recommended to address biological and technical covariates separately [107]. Designing DL models that can simultaneously handle these challenges is complex, and currently, no DL models are widely adopted for data correction in the field.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">##### 4.1.3.1 Dropout</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Dropout is a significant issue in scRNA-seq datasets, characterized by instances where a gene is expressed in one cell but not detected in another [108,109]. Dropout can result from low mRNA levels during library preparation or the stochastic nature of gene expression [110,111]. This leads to &quot;false&quot; zeros—missing values that do not reflect true gene inactivity [113]. Addressing dropouts is crucial as they introduce technical variability and noise, complicating analyses like clustering and trajectory inference [65].</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Imputation Approaches:**</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- **Traditional Methods:** Such as MAGIC [115], SAVER [116], scImpute [117], DrImpute [108], and LSImpute [118], which may not account for the non-linearity and high sparsity of scRNA-seq data.</span><br><span class="line">- **Deep Learning-Based Methods:** Primarily based on Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), offering scalable solutions for large datasets.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">**Notable DL-Based Imputation Models:**</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">- **AutoImpute [119]:** Uses overcomplete AEs to impute dropouts by learning the underlying distribution of scRNA-seq data.</span><br><span class="line">- **Deep Count AE (DCA) [26]:** Utilizes a negative binomial noise model to account for count distribution and overdispersion, scalable to millions of cells.</span><br><span class="line">- **TRANSLATE [27]:** A DL model based on AEs that assumes all zeros are missing values, effectively distinguishing between true and false zeros.</span><br><span class="line">- **SAUCIE [120]:** A regularized AE that denoises and imputes data, enhancing downstream analyses like differential gene expression.</span><br><span class="line">- **ScScope [121]:** A recurrent AE that iteratively imputes data using a recurrent network layer.</span><br><span class="line">- **DeepImpute [65] &amp; deepMC [66]:** Non-AE-based models that use sub-neural networks and deep matrix factorization, respectively.</span><br><span class="line">- **scVI [40]:** A hierarchical Bayesian model using a DNN to define conditional probabilities, accurately recovering gene expression signals.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Recent evaluations suggest that methods like ENHANCE, MAGIC, SAVER, and SAVER-X offer the best overall results in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness [122].
